This is a tile-able design to drive a 25-pixel matrix of Cree CV-94 LED clusters. These are typically used in outdoor and longer distance applications, so the visual separation of the R,G, and B LEDs is not noticeable. The board is laid out such that four can be clustered together and maintain a regular pixel spacing. The onboard driver is I2C addressable but not pre-programmed so an external controller is necessary. Example code for the Arduino environment (easily portable to other frameworks) on a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) is available.
